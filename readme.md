### Introduction
In this homework, we explore various algorithmic problems and their solutions using Python.

### Tasks
1. Task 1: Description of task 1.
step by step process
    A[Start] --> B[Define Resource Limits]
    B --> C[Create Linear Programming Model]
    C --> D[Define Decision Variables\n- Juice Bottles\n- Lemonade Bottles]
    D --> E[Add Constraints\n- Water Limit\n- Sugar Limit\n- Juice Limit\n- Pulp Limit]
    E --> F[Maximize Total Drinks]
    F --> G[Solve Optimization Model]
    G --> H[Output Optimal Production\n- Juice Bottles\n- Lemonade Bottles]
    H --> I[End]


2. Task 2: Description of task 2.
step by step process
     A[Start] --> B[Define Function f(x) = x^2]
    B --> C[Set Integration Limits\n a = 0, b = 2]
    C --> D[Generate Random Points\n Number of Points: 10000]
    D --> E[Calculate Monte Carlo Integral\n Estimate = (b-a) * Mean of f(x)]
    D --> F[Calculate Exact Integral\n Using SymPy Integration]
    E --> G[Print Estimated Integral]
    F --> H[Print Exact Integral]
    G --> I[Create Matplotlib Visualization]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Plot Function f(x)]
    I --> K[Fill Area Under Curve]
    I --> L[Add Grid and Axis Labels]
    L --> M[Display Plot]
    M --> N[End]

    The comparison of the estimated integral and the exact integral:

    The estimated integral is 2.6664
    The exact integral is 2.6667

    As for the comparison of the estimated integral and the exact integral, the estimated integral is 2.6664, while the exact integral is 2.6667. The estimated integral is very close to the exact integral, which indicates that the Monte Carlo method is a good approximation for calculating integrals, that is, the more points we use, the closer the estimated integral will be to the exact integral.

    Conclusion:
    
    The Monte Carlo method is a good approximation for calculating integrals, however if we increase the number of points, the estimated integral will be closer to the exact integral.
